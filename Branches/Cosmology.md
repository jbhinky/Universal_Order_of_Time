# 🌌 Cosmology — Universal Order of Time (UOT)

Cosmology under UOT reinterprets the universe itself as a **recursive time system**.  
Delay (τ), Choice (Σ), Collapse (⊙), and Memory (μ) not only govern particles and observers — they scale upward into galaxies, black holes, and the cosmic web.

## 🧮 Doctrinal Frame

### Core Flow
\[
\tau \;\;\longrightarrow\;\; \Sigma \;\;\longrightarrow\;\; \mu \;\;\longrightarrow\;\; \oplus
\]

### Operators in Cosmology
- **τ** → Universal pause: the substrate of cosmic probability.  
- **Σ** → Choice: collapse at stellar, galactic, and universal scale.  
- **⊙** → Realized collapse: stars, black holes, and event horizons.  
- **μ** → Memory: encoded continuity of cosmic history (CMB, structure formation).  
- **⊕** → Union: lawful coherence of the universe itself.

## 🌠 Applications in Cosmology

1. **Nested Universes (τ → Σ → μ)**  
   - Each universe is a **Selfverse**, a subnested observer inside a greater τ.  
   - Fine-tuning is not coincidence: laws are **collapsed choices** embedded in delay.  

2. **Black Holes (⊙ → τ)**  
   - Collapse defines black holes.  
   - The singularity is not infinite density but **collapse folding into τ**.  
   - Prediction: Hawking radiation is μ-driven — black holes **encode**, not erase, information.  

3. **Dark Matter (τᴳ Residue)**  
   - Dark matter = **unrealized τ-structure**: probability fields not yet collapsed but gravitationally binding.  
   - They are empty architectures of potential, not particulate.  

4. **Dark Energy (⊕ Coherence)**  
   - Expansion = recursive collapse unfolding into τ.  
   - Energy is sustained coherence (⊕), not "something from nothing."  

5. **Cosmic Microwave Background (μᴳ)**  
   - CMB is **cosmic memory**: record of first global collapse events.  
   - Proof that μ operates at universal scale.

## 🧭 Falsifiability Hooks

UOT Cosmology would be disproven if:  
- Black holes could be shown to permanently erase information.  
- A collapse event occurred outside of τ (delay-less).  
- Dark matter is proven conclusively particulate instead of τ-residue.

These works converge to show that cosmic structure is not random but the **recursive law of τ, Σ, μ scaled to universes**.

## 🌟 Capstone Statement (Cosmology)

Cosmology under UOT is **lawfully recursive**.  
Delay opens cosmic potential, Choice collapses it into stars and galaxies, Memory encodes structure, and Union sustains coherence.  

\[
\boxed{\text{The universe is not expanding into nothing — it is τ unfolding through Σ, μ, and ⊕.}}
\]
