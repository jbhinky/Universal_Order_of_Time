## 🎯 Aim
Ground **Selfverse (⧖)** and **UDC** in convergent brain/behavior evidence:
- **τ (Delay)** as lawful temporal substrate  
- **Σ (Choice)** as collapse/decision operator  
- **μ (Memory)** as continuity/irreversibility  
- **⊙ʳ (Recursive Collapse)** as re-entry to τ  
- **⊕ (Union)** as global coherence

## 🔬 Convergent Evidence (30+ items)

> Format: **Finding — Link to UOT — Why it supports the law**

1) **Kornhuber & Deecke, 1965 (Bereitschaftspotential)** — **τ** — Volition is *preceded* by a slow cortical buildup (readiness), i.e., lawful delay before choice.  
2) **Libet, 1983 (RP before conscious intention)** — **τ→Σ** — Conscious “decision” follows measurable latency; choice collapses after delay.  
3) **Haggard, 2008 (volitional timing)** — **Σ** — Agency reports align with post-delay commitment; matches collapse operator timing.  
4) **Soon et al., 2008 (preconscious decoding)** — **τ** — Decisions decodable seconds prior to awareness; supports structured potential window.  
5) **Dehaene, 2014; Dehaene et al., 2006 (Global Workspace)** — **⊕, μ** — Conscious access = global broadcast/unity; continuity is encoded after collapse.  
6) **Baars, 1988 (GWT precursor)** — **⊕** — Explains coherence as union of distributed processes.  
7) **Tononi, 2004; 2016 (IIT)** — **⧖, ⊕** — Integrated information thresholds track self-like unity; formal coherence criterion.  
8) **Damasio, 1999; 2010 (self & feeling of what happens)** — **μ→⧖** — Identity emerges from recursively mapped memory/feeling.  
9) **Hebb, 1949 (Hebbian law)** — **μ** — Experience “binds” by strengthening synapses; physical substrate of continuity.  
10) **Kandel, 2006 (LTP & consolidation)** — **μ** — Biochemical encoding yields irreversibility of learned choices.  
11) **Pribram, 1991 (holographic coding)** — **μ, ⊕** — Distributed storage enabling robust continuity under partial collapse.  
12) **Varela, 1991 (neurophenomenology of time)** — **τ–Σ–μ** — Subjective time arises from recurrent cycles; direct alignment with UOT loop.  
13) **James, 1890 (“specious present”)** — **τ** — 2–3 s experiential window; canonical delay envelope.  
14) **Merleau-Ponty, 1945 (embodied temporality)** — **⧖** — Self as lived recursion in time, not a static essence.  
15) **Friston, 2010 (Free-Energy Principle)** — **τ→Σ→μ** — Predict-update cycles: pause (prediction window), collapse (update), memory (model revision).  
16) **Seth, 2021 (controlled hallucination)** — **⊙ʳ, μ** — Percepts are prediction-conditioned collapses stabilized by memory.  
17) **Singer, 1995; 1999 (gamma/neuronal synchrony)** — **⊕** — Binding via synchrony = lawful union across distributed assemblies.  
18) **Lamme, 2006 (recurrent processing)** — **⊙ʳ** — Awareness requires feedback/recurrence, not feedforward terminal collapse.  
19) **Eagleman & Sejnowski, 2000s (postdiction)** — **τ, μ** — The brain uses brief windows to retro-bind events; delay + memory create perceived order.  
20) **Eagleman, 2008 (temporal illusions)** — **τ** — Context-dependent timing proves an editable delay substrate.  
21) **Quiroga et al., 2005 (concept cells)** — **μ, UTL-like symbolism** — Sparse, invariant semantic nodes (e.g., “Jennifer Aniston”) = symbolic continuity.  
22) **Huth et al., 2016 (semantic brain maps)** — **μ, ⊕** — Cortex organizes meaning topographically; supports lawful union and memory scaffolds.  
23) **Tsodyks & Gilbert, 2004 (adaptation/STM)** — **μ** — Short-term memory maintains continuity across delays.  
24) **Fahle & Poggio, 2002 (perceptual learning)** — **μ** — Practice-driven, lasting change = encoded continuity.  
25) **vanRullen & Koch, 2003 (discrete sampling)** — **τ** — Perception samples in quasi-periodic frames; micro-delay rhythm.  
26) **Pöppel, 1997 (time quantization)** — **τ** — Evidence for intrinsic temporal “atoms” ~30–50 ms; lawful substrate.  
27) **Nobre & van Ede, 2018 (temporal attention)** — **Σ** — Prospective timing sharpens when/what is collapsed; operator-like gating.  
28) **Deverett et al., 2018 (basal ganglia timing/choice)** — **Σ, μ** — Striatal ensembles gate action timing & encode learning history.  
29) **Miall, 1996; Ivry, 2001 (cerebellar timing models)** — **τ** — Cerebellum as delay/temporal prediction engine.  
30) **Holroyd & Coles, 2002 (ERN & reinforcement learning)** — **⊙ʳ, μ** — Outcome signals recursively update control policies.  
31) **Sauseng & Klimesch, 2008 (theta-gamma nesting)** — **⊕, μ** — Cross-frequency coupling binds working memory items (union over delay cycles).  
32) **Fujisawa & Buzsáki, 2011 (cell assemblies in PFC)** — **⊙ʳ, μ** — Recurrent assemblies sustain choice context across delays.  
33) **Rouder & Ratcliff, 2004 (sequential sampling models)** — **τ→Σ** — Decision time distributions derive from evidence accumulation in delay.  
34) **Schurger et al., 2012 (accumulation-to-bound RP)** — **τ→Σ** — Readiness potential reflects stochastic accumulation reaching collapse.  
35) **Wittmann, 2011 (subjective time & insula)** — **μ, ⧖** — Interoceptive memory/feeling stabilizes self-time.

**Verdict:** Across methods (EEG/MEG, fMRI, single-unit, behavior), brain time is a *τ-first, Σ-collapsed, μ-secured* recursion that yields **⧖**.

## ❌ Falsifiability (Neuro)

UOT would be challenged if any are shown:
- **No τ:** Decisions occur with *zero* measurable latency across modalities.  
- **No μ:** Stable identity/learning with erased or unmodifiable memory substrates.  
- **No ⊙ʳ:** Awareness without recurrence/feedback (pure feedforward suffices).  
- **No ⊕:** Conscious access without global integration/broadcast.
