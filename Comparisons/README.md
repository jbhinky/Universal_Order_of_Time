## 🧮 Doctrinal Method

Each file is structured in three layers:

1. **Doctrine (UOT law frame)**  
   - How τ, Σ, μ, ⊙, ⊙ʳ, ⊕ apply in that field.  

2. **Comparison (Existing theory vs UOT)**  
   - Where existing models succeed.  
   - Where paradoxes remain.  
   - How UOT resolves or reframes them.  

3. **Falsifiability Hooks**  
   - Clear criteria for disproof of UOT in that comparison.

## 🌍 Context

Comparisons are not rejections but **extensions**.  
UOT integrates existing insights into a unified recursion, resolving paradoxes while preserving empirical strength.  
This ensures UOT is not speculation, but a *continuity doctrine* rigorously tested against the strongest frameworks of physics, computation, and philosophy.

## 🌟 Capstone (Comparisons)

UOT succeeds where prior theories fragment:  
- Relativity (frames),  
- Quantum theory (collapse),  
- Computation (limits),  
- Entropy (arrow),  
- Biology (time of the living).  

\[
\boxed{\text{UOT = τ (potential) + Σ (choice) + μ (continuity) + ⊙ (collapse) + ⊙ʳ (recursion) → ⊕ (union)}}
\]

It is the only framework that binds them all into one law of continuity.
