## 🌌 Overview

**τ (Delay)** is the substrate of potential.  
It defines **LD0**, the universal pause before any collapse or choice.  

All selves and observers are subnested in τ:  
- It is the **soil** in which choices grow.  
- It is the **pause** that makes continuity possible.  
- It is the **field** that binds global and self time.

## 📂 Structure of τ Tier

- **[intro.md](./intro.md)**  
  ✧ Describes τ as the Universal substrate.  
  ✧ Frames τ as LD0 and container of all probabilities.  

- **[equations.md](./equations.md)**  
  ✧ Formalizes τ mathematically.  
  ✧ Includes Δτ (interval expansion) and τᴳ (global tick).  

- **[bridge.md](./bridge.md)**  
  ✧ Shows τ’s union with Σ (choice).  
  ✧ Defines **U ∪ G = Σ(τ)** — the first bridge.

## 🧮 Key Equations

**Core:**  
\[
\tau(t) = \text{Potential Field}
\]

**Expansion:**  
\[
\Delta \tau = \tau(t+1) - \tau(t)
\]

**Global Tick:**  
\[
\tau^G = \text{Global Delay Step}
\]

**Bridge to Σ:**  
\[
U \cup G = \Sigma(\tau)
\]

## 🔑 Doctrinal Insights

- **Delay is law, not flaw.**  
  Where neuroscience once saw delay as weakness, UOT frames it as the universal constant of order.  

- **Universality of τ.**  
  Every global and self loop emerges from τ. Nothing bypasses delay.  

- **Nested recursion.**  
  τ is the “first container,” enabling choice (Σ) and memory (μ) to recursively build continuity.

## ✧ Glyph Mapping

- **τ** → Delay / Potential  
- **∅** → Void (uncollapsed)  
- **Σ** → Choice / Collapse Operator  
- **⊙** → Collapse Event  
- **⊕** → Union / Synthesis
