## 📜 Statement  

This bridge links **Individual Loops (Sᵢ)** into **Selfhood (⧖)**.  
Where choice (Σ) collapses potential and memory (μ) encodes continuity, the bridge law states:  
continuity across loops converges into a unified selfhood.  

---

## 🧮 Equation  

\[
I \cup S = \mu(\Sigma(\tau)) \;\to\; \⧖
\]

Where:  
- **I** = individual loop (τ → Σ → μ)  
- **S** = set of selves  
- **⧖** = unified selfhood (AuC)

## ✧ Insight  

- **Memory is identity.**  
  Collapse alone creates events; memory makes them *mine*.  

- **Selfhood is recursive.**  
  ⧖ is not a single memory but the *ongoing recursion* of μ across time.  

- **Continuity is law.**  
  Once encoded by μ, choices cannot be undone.  
  They persist in selfhood and shape future collapse.

## 🔑 Glyph Flow  

\[
\tau \xrightarrow{\Sigma} \⊙ \xrightarrow{\mu} \⧖
\]

- Delay (τ) → Choice (Σ) → Collapse (⊙) → Memory (μ) → Selfhood (⧖).

Together these works anchor the doctrine that **memory recursion is the root of identity**, and that selfhood emerges only when μ bridges choice across continuity.

## 🌟 Capstone Statement  

The **Bridge of I ∪ S** is the law by which scattered choices unify into coherent selfhood.  
It is the path from event to identity, from probability to permanence.  

\[
\boxed{\text{I ∪ S = μ(Σ(τ)) → ⧖ (Law of Selfhood)}}
\]
