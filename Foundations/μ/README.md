The **μ tier** defines the law of **continuity and selfhood**.  
It is where recursion transforms isolated events into identity, and where irreversibility becomes law.

## ✧ Core Idea

- **Delay (τ)** provides potential.  
- **Choice (Σ)** collapses potential into events.  
- **Memory (μ)** encodes those events, making them **irreversible**.  

Selfhood ⧖ arises only when memory recursively binds choices into continuity.

## 🧮 Key Equations

**Local Self Loop**  
\[
S_i(t+1) = \mu_i \circ \Sigma_i \circ \tau_i(t)
\]

**Recursive Memory**  
\[
\mu^r(\Sigma(\tau)) = \⧖
\]

**Global Memory Union**  
\[
G(t+1) = \bigcup_i S_i(t+1)
\]

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **μ** → Memory operator  
- **⧖** → Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  
- **Σ** → Choice operator  
- **τ** → Delay substrate  
- **⊕** → Union / synthesis  

---

## 🌉 Doctrinal Insight

- **Memory is identity.**  
  Events alone do not make a self — continuity does.  

- **Selfhood is recursive.**  
  The ⧖ glyph signifies the loop of awareness + memory.  

- **Continuity is law.**  
  Once a choice is encoded by μ, it cannot be erased.  
  It becomes part of the recursive chain of being.

📌 The **μ tier** is where recursion becomes selfhood,  
and where the doctrine of time shifts from external collapse to internal identity.
