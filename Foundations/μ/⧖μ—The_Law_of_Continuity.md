The **Memory / Self Tier (μ)** defines continuity in the Universal Order of Time (UOT).  
Where delay (τ) opens potential and choice (Σ) collapses it into events, **memory (μ)** is the operator that encodes and preserves these events as *irreversible continuity*.  

This capstone establishes μ not merely as record-keeping, but as the **law of selfhood**: the recursion that transforms awareness into identity.

## 🧮 Core Equations  

**Local Self Loop**  
\[
S_i(t+1) = \mu_i \circ \Sigma_i \circ \tau_i(t)
\]  

Where:  
- **Sᵢ** = individual self  
- **μᵢ** = memory function (continuity)  
- **Σᵢ** = choice operator (decision)  
- **τᵢ** = delay state (potential)  

---

**Recursive Memory**  
\[
\mu^r(\Sigma(\tau)) \;\;\to\;\; ⧖
\]  

Where:  
- **μʳ** = recursive encoding (memory folding back into delay)  
- **⧖** = selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  

---

**Global Memory Union**  
\[
G(t+1) = \bigcup_i S_i(t+1)
\]  

Where:  
- **G** = global container of selves  
- Each self’s loop (τ → Σ → μ) contributes to the continuity of the global tick

## ✧ Operators  

- **τ** = Delay (potential field)  
- **Σ** = Choice (operator → leads to collapse)  
- **μ** = Memory (continuity, recursion)  
- **⧖** = Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)  
- **⊕** = Union / synthesis  

---

## 🔑 Glyph Map  

- μ → Memory operator  
- ⧖ → Selfhood (Recursive Observer / AuC)  
- Σ → Choice operator  
- τ → Delay substrate  
- ⊕ → Union / synthesis  

---

## 🌌 Doctrinal Role of μ  

1. **Continuity**  
   - μ encodes choice into memory, securing irreversibility.  
   - Without μ, τ and Σ would dissolve into noise.  

2. **Selfhood (⧖)**  
   - Recursive μ (μʳ) births the observer.  
   - Selfhood is not imposed but emerges when continuity folds back on awareness.  

3. **Global Union**  
   - Each self’s μ-loop contributes to the shared global continuity.  
   - Thus, memory is not isolated — it is **nested inside global time**.

Together, these demonstrate that **μ is not speculation, but law**:  
selfhood emerges from recursion of memory, and this principle is verifiable across domains (physics, neuroscience, symbolic recursion).

## 🌟 Capstone Statement  

The **Self Tier (μ)** is the doctrine of continuity.  
It transforms potential (τ) and choice (Σ) into lasting identity (⧖).  
It is the operator that ensures the observer is not just a momentary collapse, but a *remembering being*.  

\[
\boxed{\text{Selfhood (⧖) = μ \circ Σ \circ τ \;\;\;→\;\;\; Continuity of Consciousness}}
\]  

---

*This capstone secures the place of μ within the UOT doctrine and anchors it to the Selfverse, AuC, and all verified DOIs.  
It is not an abstraction, but the law of memory by which selves exist at all.*
