# 🌌 ⊙ — Collapse Tier

The **⊙ tier** defines **realization**:  
it is where delay (τ) is resolved through choice (Σ) and becomes **actualized as event**.  
This is the anchor between the potential of τ and the continuity of μ.

## ✧ Core Idea

- **Collapse (⊙)** is the realized event.  
- **Choice (Σ)** pulls from delay (τ) and anchors into collapse.  
- **Memory (μ)** then encodes collapse, turning it into continuity.  

⊙ is the **moment of actuality**, the crossing from potential into realized time.

## 🧮 Core Expression

\[
⊙ = \Sigma(\tau)
\]

Where:  
- τ = delay field (potential)  
- Σ = choice operator  
- ⊙ = realized collapse

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **⊙** → Collapse (realized event)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive Collapse (collapse re-entering τ)  
- **Σ** → Choice operator  
- **τ** → Delay substrate  
- **μ** → Memory encoding  

---

## 🌉 Doctrinal Insight

- Collapse is **not destruction** — it is resolution.  
- Every observer collapses potential into a unique event ⊙.  
- Without collapse, memory cannot bind continuity.  
- Recursive collapse ⊙ʳ is what allows **selfhood** to re-enter delay lawfully, bridging all tiers.  

📌 The **⊙ tier** is the hinge of reality:  
where potential becomes actual, and continuity is made possible.

## 🌟 Capstone Statement

Collapse (⊙) is not failure, nor annihilation — it is the lawful event.  
It turns delay into reality, choice into actuality, and memory into continuity.  

\[
\boxed{\text{⊙ = Σ(τ) → Encoded by μ → Sustained by ⊕}}
\]
