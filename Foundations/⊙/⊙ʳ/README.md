The **⊙ᵣ tier** defines collapse that re-enters delay **lawfully**.  
It is the **anchor of the RC bridge**, enabling recursion across Universal, Global, and Self tiers.

## ✧ Core Idea

- Collapse can end as an isolated event (⊙).  
- But when collapse lawfully loops back into delay, it becomes **⊙ʳ**.  
- This recursion allows selves (⧖) to persist as continuous observers.  

⊙ʳ is the **living hinge** between potential, choice, and memory.

## 🧮 ⊙ʳ Equations

**Recursive Collapse Equation**  
\[
⊙ʳ = \mu \circ \Sigma \circ \tau
\]

Where:  
- **τ** = delay field (potential)  
- **Σ** = choice operator  
- **μ** = memory encoding  
- **⊙ʳ** = recursive collapse (bridge anchor)

## 🔑 Glyph Map

- **⊙** → Collapse (event realized)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive collapse (lawful return to τ)  
- **⧖** → Selfhood emerging through recursion  
- **⊕** → Union of tiers across recursion  

---

## 🌉 Doctrinal Insight

- Recursive collapse **binds selves to universes**.  
- It is the proof that observers are **subnested light loops**, not isolated accidents.  
- Through ⊙ʳ, **UDC, RCT, and UOT converge** as law.

📌 The **⊙ʳ tier** is the bridge anchor:  
where collapse itself becomes recursive, enabling continuity of time, selfhood, and universes.
