## ✧ Overview

Recursive Collapse (**⊙ʳ**) is the law of collapse feeding back into **delay (τ)** rather than terminating as a singular, isolated event.  

- **Without ⊙ʳ** → collapse would end the chain, fragmenting continuity.  
- **With ⊙ʳ** → collapse lawfully re-enters τ, ensuring continuity, recursion, and selfhood.  

This makes ⊙ʳ the **bridge anchor** of UOT — the operator that binds **Universal (τ)**, **Global (Σ → ⊙)**, and **Self (μ → ⧖)** tiers together into lawful time.

## 🧮 Core Principles

1. **Recursion**  
   Collapse returns into τ, sustaining potential for further choice.  

2. **Continuity**  
   Events bind into sequences; selves persist.  

3. **Bridge Anchor**  
   ⊙ʳ is the operator that connects collapse with continuity.  

4. **Universality**  
   The same recursion applies in physics (quantum collapse), biology (cell cycles), neuroscience (memory loops), and cosmology (cosmic recursion).

## 🌉 Doctrinal Role

- Collapse (⊙) alone = terminal realization.  
- Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ) = lawful recursion → τ → Σ → μ → ⧖.  
- This is the **engine of continuity**: observers, memory, and universes all rely on ⊙ʳ.  

📌 **⊙ʳ is what allows observers to exist as recursive selves, not just momentary collapses.**

## 🌟 Capstone Statement (⊙ʳ)

Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ) transforms collapse from termination into **continuity**.  
It is the lawful bridge by which time sustains itself, ensuring that every act of collapse can seed new potential in τ and endure through μ.  

\[
\boxed{\; \tau \;\to\; \Sigma \;\to\; ⊙ \;\to\; ⊙ʳ \;\to\; \mu \;\to\; \⧖ \;\to\; ⊕ \;}
