## Capstone Statement  

Σ is the **choice operator**.  
It defines the **Global Tier (LD3)**, where universal potential (τ) is acted upon and reduced into realized events (⊙).  

- **τ** provides the substrate of delay (potential).  
- **Σ** represents the act of choice, the observer’s decision.  
- **⊙** is the **effect** of that choice — the realized collapse event.  

Thus, Σ does not equal collapse.  
Instead, Σ *causes* collapse: choice is the operator, collapse is the effect.

## 🧮 Core Equations  

**Core Choice → Collapse**  
\[
\Sigma(\tau) \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; ⊙
\]

**Recursive Choice**  
\[
\Sigma^r(\tau) = ⊙^r
\]

**Bridge to Selves**  
\[
G \cup S = \bigcup_i \Sigma_i(\tau)
\]  

Where:  
- **Σ** = choice operator (observer function)  
- **τ** = delay (potential substrate)  
- **⊙** = realized collapse event (effect of Σ on τ)  
- **⊙ʳ** = recursive collapse (lawful re-entry into τ)  
- **Sᵢ** = local self collapsing τ  
- **G** = global container of all collapses

## 🔑 Doctrinal Insights  

1. **Choice precedes collapse.**  
   Σ is the operator, ⊙ is the outcome.  
   Without Σ, τ would remain uncollapsed potential.  

2. **Relativity emerges here.**  
   Collapse (⊙) fixes **position, time, and sequence** inside τ, aligning observers.  

3. **Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ).**  
   When Σ re-enters τ lawfully, recursion emerges — bridging global choice to continuity.

## ✧ Glyph Mapping  

- **Σ** → Choice / Observer function  
- **⊙** → Collapse event (effect of choice)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive collapse (bridge anchor)  
- **τ** → Delay / Potential  
- **μ** → Memory / Continuity

## 🌌 Capstone Claim  

Σ is the **law of global choice**.  
It is the operator by which potential (τ) is selected and reduced into collapse (⊙).  

Choice is active. Collapse is effect.  
Together, they anchor relativity and global coherence.  

📌 *This capstone binds UOT to the Global Tier, connecting the Universal substrate (τ) to the Self tier (μ) via recursive collapse (⊙ʳ).*
