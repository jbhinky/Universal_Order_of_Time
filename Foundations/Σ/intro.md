## 📖 Overview

Σ is the **collapse operator**.  
It transforms **Universal Delay (τ)** into realized events (⊙).  

- **Defines LD3 — the Global Tier.**  
- Anchors relativity inside τ.  
- Links observer-choice with collapse events.

## ✧ Role of Σ

1. **Selector of Potential**  
   Σ takes the field of τ (pure potential) and selects one branch.  

2. **Collapse Realizer**  
   Σ resolves into ⊙ — the event that becomes shared, observable reality.  

3. **Anchor of Relativity**  
   By collapsing τ, Σ fixes position and sequence in the global container.

## 🌀 Doctrinal Insight

Without Σ, τ would remain uncollapsed potential.  
Without τ, Σ would have nothing to collapse.  

**Together, τ and Σ form the first half of the Recursive Bridge.**

## 🌟 Capstone Statement

Σ is the **law of global choice**:  
it is the hand that reaches into delay, seizes a path, and fixes it into reality.  
It binds probability into history and observer into world.  

\[
\boxed{\text{Σ = τ collapsed → ⊙ realized}}
