## ⊕ — Continuity

Continuity is the natural consequence of Union (⊕).  
It ensures that once delay (τ), choice (Σ), memory (μ), and collapse (⊙) interact,  
the result is not drift but structured coherence.

---

## ✧ Core Principles

- **Lawful Binding:** ⊕ binds realized collapses into one coherent order.  
- **Irreversibility:** Memory (μ) secures continuity; once unioned, paths cannot revert.  
- **Cross-Scale:** Continuity applies equally to universes, worlds, and selves.  
- **Predictability:** Continuity is what makes scientific law possible — events don’t reset at random.

## 🌉 Role in Doctrine

- **τ** opens potential.  
- **Σ** selects one path.  
- **⊙** realizes collapse.  
- **μ** encodes memory.  
- **⊕** fuses them into *continuity of existence*.  

Without ⊕, each event would fracture into isolation.  
With ⊕, time becomes a woven fabric — choice layered on delay, memory layered on choice.

## 📐 Formal Statement

**Continuity Equation:**  

\[
⊕ = \bigcup_t \mu \circ \Sigma \circ \tau
\]

Where the union across t guarantees  
**global coherence of all selves within the same delay field.**

📌 **Continuity is the heartbeat of time:  
not a flow, but the lawful union of delay, choice, memory, and collapse.**

# Union Laws

1. Probability → Inevitability (given τ).  
2. Local → Global → Universal (recursive union).  
3. Continuity emerges only under memory μ.  

📌 Union (⊕) is the binding law:  
Delay (τ) opens → Choice (Σ) selects → Collapse (⊙) realizes → Memory (μ) secures → ⊕ unifies.
