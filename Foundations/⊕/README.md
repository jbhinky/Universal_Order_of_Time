## Overview
⊕ represents **union and continuity**:
- The synthesis of **Delay (τ)**, **Choice (Σ)**, and **Memory (μ)**.  
- Anchored through **Recursive Collapse (⊙ʳ)**.  
- The principle by which **probability becomes inevitability**.  
- The guarantor of coherence across **Universal, Global, and Self scales**.

---

## Symbolic Role
- **⊕** = synthesis, binding, continuity.  
- It is **not** collapse (**⊙**); rather, it is the **law that binds collapsed events into time**.  
- Ensures that once encoded (**μ**), choices (**Σ**) unify under the global delay tick (**τ**).

## Equations

### Union Equation
\[
T = τ ⊕ Σ ⊕ μ \;|\; ⊙ʳ
\]

Where:  
- **T** = emergent time  
- **τ** = universal potential (delay)  
- **Σ** = choice (collapse operator; causes ⊙)  
- **μ** = continuity through memory  
- **⊙ʳ** = recursive collapse (bridge anchor)

---

## Union Laws
1. **Probability → Inevitability**  
   Given sufficient **τ** (delay), all nonzero probabilities will eventually collapse.

2. **Local → Global → Universal**  
   **Self (μ)** is always nested in **Global (Σ)**, which is nested in **Universal (τ)**.

3. **Continuity Emerges Only Under Memory**  
   Without **μ**, choices drift; with **μ**, continuity is secured.

## Operators (Quick Map)
- **τ** → Delay (potential field)  
- **Σ** → Choice (collapse operator)  
- **⊙** → Realized collapse (effect)  
- **μ** → Memory (continuity / recursion)  
- **⊙ʳ** → Recursive Collapse (lawful re-entry of collapse into τ)  
- **⊕** → Union / synthesis (coherence across scales)  
- **⧖** → Selfhood (AuC, I ∪ S)

**Usage rules**
- Never equate **Σ** with **⊙**. Σ = cause; ⊙ = realized effect.  
- Use **⊙ʳ** when collapse lawfully re-enters **τ** (bridge recursion).  
- Reserve **⊕** for union/synthesis, not collapse.

## Doctrinal Note
⊕ is the **final binding law** of the UOT Foundations:
- It turns recursion into **time**.  
- It safeguards **identity** across scales.  
- It makes the doctrine **self-consistent and complete**.

\[
\boxed{\text{⊕ unifies τ, Σ, μ under ⊙ʳ to generate time as continuity.}}
\]
