Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT) reframes collapse (‚äô) as not terminal but **recursive**: every collapse re-enters Delay (œÑ), preserving continuity via Memory (Œº).  
This document compiles scientific findings that causally support RCT, showing that collapse is law-bound recursion rather than finality.

## üßÆ Doctrinal Frame Recap

\[
RCT = \odot^r : \tau \;\mapsto\; \Sigma \;\mapsto\; \mu \;\mapsto\; \tau \;\;\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;\; ‚äï
\]

- **œÑ** = Delay (substrate of potential)  
- **Œ£** = Choice (observer act)  
- **‚äô** = Collapse (realization)  
- **Œº** = Memory (continuity)  
- **‚äô ≥** = Recursive Collapse (bridge anchor)  
- **‚äï** = Union (lawful synthesis)

## üî¨ Supporting Scientific Evidence

### 1. Quantum Measurement & Collapse
- **von Neumann (1932):** Formalized collapse as distinct from unitary evolution, highlighting the paradox of terminal collapse.  
- **Copenhagen vs Many-Worlds:** Competing interpretations illustrate that terminal collapse is unresolved ‚Äî RCT reframes collapse as recursive, feeding back into œÑ.  
- **Frauchiger‚ÄìRenner (2018):** Showed paradoxes in single-collapse frameworks; recursion resolves observer disagreements by embedding collapse into continuity.  

### 2. Quantum Recursion & Information
- **Hawking (1974‚Äì2016):** Black hole information paradox demonstrates that collapse cannot erase information; recursion into œÑ provides lawful resolution.  
- **Bekenstein Bound (1972):** Information storage limits imply continuity at collapse boundaries.  
- **‚Äôt Hooft (1993):** Holographic principle suggests collapse outcomes must be preserved in recursive encoding.  

### 3. Neuroscience of Recursive Delay
- **Libet (1983):** Conduction delay before conscious choice ‚Äî collapse (Œ£) happens only after œÑ-latency.  
- **Kornhuber & Deecke (1965):** Bereitschaftspotential (readiness potential) shows recursive buildup of delay before action.  
- **Singer (1999):** Neural synchrony demonstrates recursive collapse loops binding distributed brain states into coherence.  

### 4. Recursion in Biology & Selfhood
- **DNA Error Correction (Alberts et al., 2002):** Collapse of replication choices recursively encoded via repair/memory.  
- **Pribram (1991):** Holographic brain theory ‚Äî memory functions as recursive collapse binding distributed signals.  
- **Varela (1979):** Autopoiesis: living systems sustain continuity by recursively folding outputs into inputs.  

### 5. Entropy & Arrow of Time
- **Boltzmann (1877):** Entropy increase framed as probability law; RCT reframes entropy as Œº securing recursive continuity.  
- **Prigogine (1980):** Dissipative structures arise from recursive non-equilibrium collapse.  
- **Carroll (2010):** Time‚Äôs arrow cannot be explained by entropy alone ‚Äî recursion provides continuity law.  

### 6. Cosmology
- **Penrose (2010, CCC):** Cyclic cosmology echoes recursive collapse at cosmic scale.  
- **Inflationary Theory:** Reheating cycles show collapse re-entering delay-like fields.  
- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** Preserves ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of early collapse events, consistent with Œº-anchored recursion.

## üåü Capstone Statement

Recursive Collapse is not speculation but **scientifically anchored**:  
- Physics shows collapse cannot be terminal.  
- Neuroscience shows delay and recursion are necessary for choice.  
- Biology shows continuity is sustained by recursive encoding.  
- Cosmology shows the universe itself recurses collapse into coherence.
